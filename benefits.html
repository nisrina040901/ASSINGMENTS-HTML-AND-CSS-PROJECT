    1. Prevents disease
  </div>
  <div class="ParagraphBenefits3">
    Healthy habits can reduce the risk of various diseases, including those that may run in your family.

    For example, in a recent study, adults who followed a standard American diet (rich in fruits and 
    vegetables) for 8 weeks had a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.

    In another 2020 studyTrusted Source, researchers found that every 66-gram increase in daily fruit 
    and vegetable intake was associated with a 25 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

    Swapping out some refined grains for whole grains also reduces the risk of disease. In an observational 
    studyTrusted Source of almost 200,000 adults, those who ate the most whole grains had a 29 percent lower 
    rate of type 2 diabetes than those who ate the least.

    2. Saves money
  </div>
  <div class="ParagraphBenefits3">
    It’s always smart to see your primary care physician for an annual physical exam. This is especially true
    seeing how some health conditions, such as high blood pressure, are “silent.” This means they don’t have any 
    symptoms, so unless you are checked, you usually don’t know you have the condition.
    
    However, the healthier you are, the less likely you will have to see a doctor. This could save money by 
    reducing co-pays, the need for prescriptions, and other treatments.
  </div>

  <div class="ParagraphBenefits2">
    3. Lengthens lifespan
  </div>
  <div class="ParagraphBenefits3">
    Basic healthy habits are connected with living a longer life. If, at age 50, you’ve never smoked, maintain a healthy weight, are regularly active, follow a healthy diet, and keep alcohol to a moderate consumption, you could live up to 14 yearsTrusted Source longer.
   Making even a few of these changes could lengthen your lifespan.
  </div>

  <div class="ParagraphBenefits2">
    4. It can be good for the environment
  </div> 
  <div class="ParagraphBenefits3">
    Ultra-processed foods are those that contain refined grains and additives to change the texture, taste, or color. 
    Some examples of these foods are cheese puffs, packaged dessert cakes, chicken nuggets, and sweetened breakfast cereals. More than 70 percent of foods in U.S. supermarkets are ultra-processed.

    The making of ultra-processed foods contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, decreased biodiversity, 
    plastic waste, and deforestation.
