    Make most of your meal<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/vegetables-and-fruits/">vegetables and fruits</a> : ½ of your plate.
    Aim for color and variety, and remember that potatoes don’t count
    as vegetables on the Healthy Eating Plate because of their negative impact on blood sugar.

  <div class="ParagraphHealthyPlates3">
    Go for <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/whole-grains/">whole grains</a> : ¼ of your plate.
    Whole and intact grains—whole wheat, barley, wheat berries, <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/quinoa/">quinoa</a>, oats,<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/rice/">brown rice</a>, and foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta—have a milder effect on blood sugar and 
    insulin than white bread, white rice, and other refined grains.

    Limit red meat, and avoid processed meats such as bacon and sausage.

  <div class="ParagraphHealthyPlates3">
    <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/">Healthy plants oil</a>: in moderation.
    Choose healthy vegetable oils like olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and others, and avoid partially hydrogenated oils,
   which contain unhealthy trans fats. Remember that <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2012/06/21/ask-the-expert-healthy-fats/">low-fat does not mean "healthy"</a>.
